1)How do I approach designing software?
  - In the beginning of this class I came into the software development with an open mind to learn as much as possible and with the little knowledge I knew of C++ I thought I would of been okay at this class.  I ran into alot of issues from getting the visual studio to run the images and to creating the 3D scene but now I approach it with the mindset of being narrow and goal oriented.  There is alot of work that went into the thought process and development of the code to make it executable and perform the way you want and this experience will help translate into my career as being goal driven and strive to challenges to either overcome them or to fail but learn how to succeed.  
  
2)How do I approach developing programs?
  - So far within my degree I have now used a total of 3 different programs to run code in and makes it difficult to master something if you are constantly switching the program and have to learn something now and how it works.  OpenGL w/ visual studio was difficult because i've never dealt with visual studio before and im more familiar with Eclipse as thats one of the others i perform in throught my degree.  Through each of the weeks assignment I felt my skills for coding got a lttle by little stronger but not strong enought where I feel like i can tackle it on my own truly.  From the early difficutlies to picking it up towards the end to have a completed projects, there were alot of road bumps.  Ultimately I finished and set out to complete part of what my picture looked like in week 2.

3)How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - I believe my goals in what I want to accomplish with my career choice will truly not reflect what this class has taught me.  I dont believe I will be dealing with OpenGL at all as being a project manager as im not even sure I want to be a manager within the CS field.  It has gained me enough knowledge to help others if they were taking a class like this to the point where I can give directions on the ability to build shapes and placements while providing the depth and scale.  I didnt know what to expect from this class and thankfully it is over and I can continue getting a term closer to graduating and developing the career im hoping for.
